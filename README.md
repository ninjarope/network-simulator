# Network Simulator

This page outlines the usage and architecture of the program while also instructing how to generate the doxygen api documentation. License and team information at the bottom.

---

## Usage

+ Build with make (Makefile included and should handle most platforms)

 Running the executive:

```
./ns [relative-xml-file-path]
./ns [relative-xml-file-path] > log.txt
./ns random [node-count] [edge-count] [packet-generator-count]
```

### Examples:

Random

```
./ns random 50 50 10
./ns random 10 20 5
./ns random 1000 1000 100
```

XML specified

```
./ns resources/simple.xml
./ns resources/default.xml
./ns resources/large.xml
```

### Control and specifications

+ Shows a gui that has few keys mapped and mouse controls. Runs a 10s elapse by default.
+ Some of the controls work by holding alt and pressing mouse button on a node
+ To modify the network, use xml files (resources directory).

#### Basic xml layout:

```xml
<network interval="10" slowdownrate="1.0" endTime="10000">
    <node address="somename" x="1.0" y="1.0">
        <application type="PacketReceiver"/>
        <application type="PacketGenerator"/>
           <destination address="A"/>
           ... more destinations ...
        
        ... more applications ...

    </node>

    ... more nodes ...

    <link source="A" destination="B" directed="false" type="Wireless" speed="1.0" delay="1.0" weight="1.0"/>
    
    ... more links ...

</network>
```

+ Network's parameters are optional
    + interval = ms for every step
    + slowdownrate = the bigger, the slower
    + endTime = end point for the intervals
+ Applications to be used are 
    + PacketReceiver
    + PacketGenerator - defines the destinations for the generated packets
    + RandomRouter - is random
    + RTableRouter - uses the nodes routing table
+ Routing can be done with 
    + the random applications
    + with aforementioned links (xml) between nodes.
    + few implemented path algorithms (Currently only shortest path is implemented)
        + This requires tweeking of the code

## Architecture

Classes are intended to follow loose coupling principles where applicable. It follows MVC-model abstracting the view layer. There's few other view layers implemented, but they are mostly for testing purposes. 

Threading has been implemented with computing the node and link changes. Synchronization has been taken into account, though it is yet to be tested thoroughly. This separation from the main-thread enables the view layer to operate reactively even if the background tasks are slowed down. 

### NetworkSimulator

+ Control layer for the program.
+ The NetworkSimulator inherits a Network and a Timer thus enclosing their functionality.

#### Network

+ Network has function which returns pointers to all links / nodes in network

Example of getting a specific node by address:

    `network.getNode("some address")`

#### Timer

+ Clocks the processes in the program.
+ Can be paused.

### Node

+ Abstract layer for the nodes (mainly the ApplicationNode)

#### ApplicationNode

+ An ApplicationNode (subclass of Node) has a vector of Applications, which are activated for the receives and sends every clock cycle. Applications process host node's packet queue by reference, so the order of the applications is crucial.

### Application

+ Application serve as a base class for Application logic / in other words for Routers, PacketGenerators (spew random packets) etc.

#### ApplicationFactory

+ ApplicationFactory can be used for spawning concrete implementations of the Application class.

### Link

+ Links are composed of a pair of two nodes = pair<Node *, Node *>.

+ The simplest link type is a directed link, but undirected or bidirectional links are implicit in current implementations. They are implemented by having two directed links.

#### ParametricLink

+ Links have source and address. They also enclose parameters for speed, delay and weight to simulate bandwidth, latency and other such factors.

## Testing

+ Uses [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) testing framework

+ Basic usage is through arguments. The executive can be run normally by not giving it any parameters. Parameters override the executive to be utilized for testing.

Running tests for xml (linux):

```
./ns "[tag]" <options>
```

./ns refers to the built executive. The arguments include the tag of the test and options for the tests. To get tags for all tests use:

```
./ns -l
```

and for help and usage:

```
./ns -h
```

## Documentation

+ Included in the root folder are two doxygen configuration files. 

Doxygen documentation can be generated with these configuration by running:

    `doxygen <doxygen-conf-file>`

This will create documentation in html by default of the classes and their related material

### Requirements for the documentation

Doxygen - of course - to generate the documentation with it. This is the only requirement, if the non-graphs configuration is used.

The directory ./doc might be necessary to create by hand, if doxygen doesn't handle directory creation for you.
    
Graphviz should be installed to use doxygen with the graph enabled configuration. The graphs are built with graphviz's dot tool.

### Commenting for the documentation

Doxygen understands many variations of commenting. We should use these conventions:

    /**
     * Block comments for longer comments (classes etc)
     */

    /** one liners, that should be included in the doxygen */

    /* one liners that are only for code reading / no doxygen support */

    // same as the above (one liners)
