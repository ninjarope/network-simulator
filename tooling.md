# Working Methods and Tooling

Tasks documented in our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/V5kvJxMU/network-stimulator-final-sprint-ends-10-12). 

We approximated Scrumm with sprints, some syncs and sprint plannings. These can be reviewed from our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/V5kvJxMU/network-stimulator-final-sprint-ends-10-12) that we have opened up public for your viewing convenience. 

The development time was divided into week to two week long sprints. The initial plan was to have 4 sprints, but they resulted to be just too short to get anything done. At the end of each sprint we intended to have a 'deliverable' ready, meaning we'd have something to show.
